# Advent of Code 2021
## What is it all about?

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Goals:
1. To have all of the puzzles solved by the end January.
2. To write my own solutions to all the problems (no [/r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) peeking!).
3. To improve my understanding of Java and Version Control.
4. Make code as readable and easy to understand as possible.

## Current progress: 15/25
### Puzzles solved
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16
