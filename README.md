# Advent of Code 2021
## What is it all about?

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

## Goals:
1. To have all of the puzzles solved by the end January.

3. To improve my understanding of Java and Version Control.
4. Make code as readable and easy to understand as possible.
